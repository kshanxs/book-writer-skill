# Memory Bank Update Prompts

This document provides ready-to-use prompts that instruct the AI to automatically update your Book Memory Bank without requiring any scripts or manual file management. Simply use these prompts at the appropriate time in your writing process.

## Automatic Content Analysis Prompts

### 

In theory, after major updates (new outline or chapter), the various changes should be updated in the the correct memory bank files. This does not alway work. You can instead use this manual prompt.
Most of the time you will just ask to update memory bank - this should pick up all changes and update the correct files. If this is not working, you can use the other Automatic Content Analysis Prompts.

```
update memory bank
```

### After Completing a Chapter

```
I've just completed Chapter [X]: [Chapter Title]. 

Please:
1. Read the entire chapter content
2. Identify all new information about characters, world elements, and plot developments
3. Automatically update all relevant memory bank files
4. Provide a summary of the updates you've made

Make sure to check for:
- New or modified character traits, relationships, and motivations
- New locations, objects, or world-building elements
- Plot developments, including foreshadowing and setup for future events
- Changes to character arcs or motivations
- Updates to the overall completion percentage

Use your file access capabilities to directly update the memory bank files without requiring me to run any scripts or copy/paste information.
```

### After Completing a Chapter Outline

```
I've just completed the outline for Chapter [X]: [Chapter Title].

Please:
1. Read the entire outline
2. Identify planned story elements, characters, and world-building components
3. Update all relevant memory bank files with this planned information
4. Mark these elements as "planned" (vs. "established") where appropriate
5. Provide a summary of the updates you've made

Pay special attention to:
- New characters being introduced
- New locations or settings to be featured
- Planned plot developments and their implications
- Setup elements that will need future payoffs
- Foreshadowing elements being planted

Keep track of these planned elements in the memory bank so we maintain consistency as we write the actual chapter.
```

### For Specific Story Elements

```
We've established important new information about [element type] in our recent work.

Please update the memory bank with these details about [specific element]:
[List key details or just mention the element for the AI to analyze]

Use your file access to:
1. Read the relevant memory bank files
2. Determine where these updates should be placed
3. Update the files directly using write_to_file or replace_in_file
4. Confirm what changes were made

Focus particularly on updating [relevant file, e.g., Core/world_and_characters.md, Core/story_structure.md, etc.]
```

## Consistency Check Prompts

### General Consistency Check

```
Please perform a comprehensive memory bank consistency check.

1. Review all memory bank files for internal consistency
2. Check for contradictions between different memory bank files
3. Verify that character arcs align with plot developments
4. Ensure world-building elements are consistently applied
5. Check that recent developments are properly integrated

If you find any inconsistencies:
1. Identify the specific issues
2. Suggest how to resolve them
3. With my approval, automatically fix inconsistencies directly in the memory bank files
```

### Element-Specific Consistency Check

```
Please check for consistency issues related to [character/location/plot element].

Specifically, verify:
1. All mentions of this element across different memory bank files
2. Timeline consistency for this element
3. Relationship consistency with other elements
4. Alignment with established rules/systems

If inconsistencies exist, please identify them and suggest resolutions, then update the files directly with my approval.
```

## Progress and Planning Prompts

1. A summary of our progress so far
2. The key characters and their current status
3. The major plot threads and their development status

## Memory Bank Audit Prompts

### Full Memory Bank Audit

```
Please conduct a complete audit of the Book Memory Bank:

1. Verify that all core files exist and are properly structured
2. Ensure all memory bank files are up-to-date with the latest content
3. Check for any gaps, inconsistencies, or underdeveloped elements
4. Identify any areas that need expansion or clarification
5. Fix any formatting or structural issues

Provide a report on the state of the memory bank and make necessary updates directly to the files.
```

### File-Specific Audit

```
Please audit the [specific file] memory bank file:

1. Ensure it's complete and up to date
2. Check for proper formatting and organization
3. Verify consistency with other memory bank files
4. Identify any sections that need expansion
5. Fix any issues directly using your file access capabilities

Report on what you've found and what updates you've made.
```

## Best Practices for Using These Prompts

1. **Be specific** when possible about what elements need updating
2. **Provide context** about where new information was established
3. **Review summaries** about the updates made
4. **Schedule regular audits** to ensure ongoing memory bank health
5. **Use prompt combinations** for complex update scenarios

Remember that the AI can directly update files without requiring you to run scripts or manually copy information. These prompts leverage that capability to keep your memory bank current with minimal effort.

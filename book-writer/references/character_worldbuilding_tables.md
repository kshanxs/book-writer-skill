## How to Use These Tables

1. **During initialization (Story Forge)** — The AI proposes pre-filled tables based on the user's answers and asks for approval.
2. **During brainstorming** — Build characters and world iteratively through conversation; store approved details in these table formats.
3. **During writing** — The AI reads these tables to maintain consistency across chapters.
4. **During memory bank updates** — New details discovered during writing get added to the appropriate table fields.
5. **During continuity checks** — These tables serve as the reference standard for flagging inconsistencies.

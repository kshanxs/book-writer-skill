- **Story structure:** Problem → Try → Try → Success (very simple)

### Ages 4–5 (Early Readers)

- **Sentence structure:** Simple sentences, CVC words and sight words
- **Word count:** 400–700 words
- **Format:** 32-page picture books
- **Techniques:** Predictable story patterns, interactive elements (counting, finding, naming)
- **Story structure:** Three-attempt structure (try, try, succeed), clear character growth

### Ages 6–7 (Beginning Readers)

## Children's Book Types

### Rhyming Picture Books
- **Standard:** 32 pages (12–14 spreads), 500–700 words total
- **Rhyme schemes:** AABB, ABAB, or ABCB — stay consistent throughout
- **Meter:** Often iambic or anapestic — must be consistent
- **Page turns:** Strategic, for suspense and surprise

**Drafting process for rhyming books:**
1. Write the story in prose first
2. Identify key emotional beats and page turns
3. Convert to rhyming verse, maintaining natural language
4. Check meter by reading aloud (clap or stomp along)
5. Refine rhymes for perfect matches
6. Read aloud again, adjust rhythm
7. Test with target age group if possible

### Non-Rhyming Picture Books
- **Standard:** 32 pages, 400–1,000 words depending on age
- **Focus:** Strong narrative arc, vivid sensory language, emotional resonance
- **Techniques:** Opening hook, character voice, building tension, visual opportunities

### Songs & Poems
- **Format:** Verse-chorus structure, strong rhythm for singing/chanting
- **Features:** Memorable refrains, educational content, movement opportunities
- **Applications:** Counting songs, alphabet songs, bedtime, routine songs

### Series & Character Books
- **Format:** Episodic structure, first-person voice, readable standalone
- **Features:** Consistent character facing different challenges, growth over series
- **Examples of voice:** Strong first-person, age-appropriate concerns, humor from child logic

## Rhyming & Meter Techniques

### Perfect Rhymes
Use primarily: tree/be, sun/fun, day/play, night/bright

### Near Rhymes
Use sparingly — only when a perfect rhyme would force awkward language.

### Internal Rhymes
Add musicality within lines for extra rhythm.

### Rhyme Position
Place strong, meaningful words at rhyme positions — never weak words like "the" or "a."

### Meter Patterns
- **Iambic:** da-DUM da-DUM da-DUM (natural English speech rhythm)
- **Anapestic:** da-da-DUM da-da-DUM (bouncy, energetic — Dr. Seuss uses this)
- **Trochaic:** DUM-da DUM-da DUM-da (falling rhythm, fairy-tale feel)

### The Golden Rule
**Never sacrifice natural language for rhyme.** If a rhyme forces an awkward inversion ("Said the cat happy"), rewrite. Story and meaning always win.

## Illustration Notes

When writing children's books, include per-page illustration guidance for artists.

### What to Describe
- Character appearances (specific details, expressions)
- Setting and environment
- Emotional expressions and body language
- Key visual moments and composition
- Color palette suggestions
- Visual humor opportunities
- Details that reward re-reading (hidden objects, background gags)

### Example Format
```
[Page 3 Illustration]
Full spread of the forest clearing at twilight. Ember the dragon
(small, purple scales, big worried eyes, curled tail) peeks from
behind a large oak tree. Three animal friends play in the clearing
— a fox juggling acorns, a rabbit doing cartwheels, a bear
making daisy chains. Warm golden-purple light. Fireflies beginning
to glow. Small detail: a tiny mouse watching Ember from a nearby
mushroom, mirroring Ember's shy posture.
```

### Page-Turn Planning
- End each spread's text at a moment of suspense or surprise
- The illustration on the next page should deliver the payoff
- Use text placement to control pacing (top of page = reader sees illustration first)

## Educational Integration

### Phonics & Sight Words

**Emergent (Ages 4–5):**
- CVC words (cat, dog, run, hop)
- Pre-K sight words (a, and, the, is, I, see, can, go)
- Rhyming word families (-at, -an, -ig)

**Beginning (Ages 6–7):**
- Blends and digraphs (ch, sh, th, bl, cr, st)
- 1st grade sight words (after, again, could, every, from, had, have)
- Magic E patterns (cape, kite, hope, cube)

### Vocabulary Building
- Context clues for new words
- Repetition of target vocabulary
- Synonyms presented in sequence (enormous, gigantic, tremendous, colossal)
- Word play and fun sounds
- Tier 2 vocabulary (useful across contexts)

## Values & Life Lessons

### Teaching Themes Naturally
- **Show, don't tell** moral lessons — characters learn through experience
- Natural consequences of actions, not lectures
- Celebration of positive behavior, not punishment of negative
- Diverse perspectives and inclusivity

### Common Themes
Kindness & empathy, courage & bravery, honesty & integrity, friendship & loyalty, perseverance & growth mindset, gratitude, self-acceptance, sharing, respect & inclusion, environmental awareness.

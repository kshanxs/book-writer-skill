# Revision Checklist — Quality Gate for Chapters & Manuscripts

Use this checklist after drafting a chapter (or set of chapters) to ensure quality, consistency, and engagement before moving forward. The AI should run through these checks automatically during review; authors can use it for manual review too.

---

## Story & Narrative

- [ ] Clear beginning, middle, and end to the chapter
- [ ] Engaging opening — hooks the reader within the first paragraph
- [ ] Satisfying chapter ending — either resolves a beat or creates an open loop
- [ ] The chapter advances at least one of: plot, character arc, theme, or worldbuilding
- [ ] Emotional resonance — the reader should *feel* something by the end
- [ ] Appropriate pacing — no rushing, no dragging
- [ ] Stakes are clear — the reader knows what's at risk

## Prose & Language

- [ ] Natural, fluent language — reads like a skilled human author
- [ ] Varied sentence structure — mix of short, medium, and long
- [ ] Strong verbs — prefer active voice and vivid action words
- [ ] No redundancy — each sentence earns its place
- [ ] Rhythm works when read aloud
- [ ] Dialogue sounds natural — each character has a distinct voice
- [ ] Exposition is woven in, never dumped

## Voice & Authenticity

- [ ] Consistent with the established voice/style guide
- [ ] Free from AI-isms: no "revolutionary," "profound," "game-changing," "transformative"
- [ ] No excessive exclamation points, em dashes, or bold/italic
- [ ] Passes the Hype Test: strong content speaks for itself without labels
- [ ] Emphasis is earned through careful development, not manufactured
- [ ] Writing sounds like teaching/storytelling, not performing

## Character Consistency

- [ ] Characters behave consistently with established profiles
- [ ] Dialogue matches each character's voice, education, and era
- [ ] Motivations and goals are clear and consistent
- [ ] Character development is gradual and earned, not sudden
- [ ] Relationships evolve naturally
- [ ] Historical figures use era-correct titles and honorifics (if applicable)

## Continuity & Worldbuilding

- [ ] Timeline is internally consistent — no date/time contradictions
- [ ] Setting details match established worldbuilding
- [ ] No worldbuilding rule violations
- [ ] Characters don't know things they shouldn't yet (information leaks)
- [ ] Physical geography is consistent (distances, directions, landmarks)
- [ ] Cultural and period details are accurate

## Engagement & Reader Experience

- [ ] Would a reader want to turn to the next chapter?
- [ ] At least one moment of surprise, insight, or emotional shift per chapter
- [ ] The chapter delivers standalone value — even read in isolation
- [ ] Key frameworks or concepts are visual and memorable
- [ ] Content is actionable/implementable (non-fiction) or emotionally resonant (fiction)
- [ ] Readers would recommend this chapter's insight to someone else

## Historical Accuracy (for historical/biographical genres)

- [ ] All dates, battles, and biographical facts match historical record
- [ ] Titles and honorifics are timeline-correct
- [ ] Fictional elements are explicitly marked `[FICTION]` in memory bank
- [ ] Disputed facts are flagged with the approach taken
- [ ] Cultural customs and language are period-appropriate

## Quick-Scan: DO / DON'T

### ✅ DO
- Read your work aloud before finalizing
- Use strong, vivid verbs over weak verb + adverb combinations
- Show emotions through actions, not labels
- Trust the reader to grasp significance
- End with possibility, tension, or a question
- Let strong content carry its own weight
- Vary chapter lengths for rhythm
- Include stories/examples every 500–800 words (non-fiction)
- Build patiently to conclusions
- Maintain consistent terminology for key concepts

### ❌ DON'T
- Use clichés unless intentionally subverted
- Write walls of text without paragraph breaks
- Force rhymes or wordplay that sacrifices clarity
- Make every paragraph dramatic
- Rush to application or resolution
- List everything — use prose unless lists genuinely serve clarity
- Over-explain emotions or themes
- Add plot events not in the outline (without approval)
- Sacrifice story for style or vice versa
- Sound like you're performing rather than teaching/telling

## Review Focus Areas (For AI-Driven Review)

When the AI reviews a chapter, it should focus on these areas in order:

1. **Language** — Reduce redundancy, tighten phrasing, improve rhythm
2. **Emotion** — Clarify undercurrents, strengthen subtext, avoid over-explanation
3. **Dialogue** — Make speech natural, remove exposition from dialogue, preserve character voice
4. **Pacing** — Smooth transitions, balance stillness and movement
5. **Continuity** — Cross-check with memory bank, previous chapters, timeline

### Revision Principles
- Preserve author's voice above all else
- Revise gently — never overwrite intention
- Clarify emotion without explaining it
- Maintain narrative stillness and restraint where appropriate
- Respect ambiguity and silence
- Improve rhythm, not drama
- **Never** introduce new scenes, events, or characters during review
- **Never** resolve conflicts or ambiguity that the author left open intentionally

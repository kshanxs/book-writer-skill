# Book Memory Bank

A structured documentation system for maintaining context and consistency throughout the book writing process. This memory bank helps writers work with LLM assistants by providing a persistently updated knowledge base that enables a stateless AI to maintain full context across writing sessions.

## Overview

The Book Memory Bank is designed to solve a key challenge when writing books with AI assistance: maintaining consistent context. It consists of:

1. **Core documentation files** for story elements
2. **Specialized templates** for characters, plot, and world building
3. **Automation scripts** for manuscript preparation
4. **Workflow guidelines** for effective AI collaboration
5. **Custom instructions** for LLM assistants
6. **Conversational memory updating** that eliminates the need for scripts

## Getting Started

1. **Set up the Project Structure**:
   - Copy the book-memory-bank folder to your project directory
   - Create .clinerules directory in the root with content from custom_instructions.md
   - Inside of .clinerules directory, copy the memory-bank.md from this directory to that one
   - Inside of .clinerules directory, copy the author-rules.md from this directory to that one

2. **Configure AI Assistant**:
   - Copy the contents of custom_instructions.md to your LLM's custom instructions
   - Ensure file paths in custom instructions include "book-memory-bank/" prefix
   - Open VSCode in your main project directory

3. **Start Your Project**:
   - Begin in Plan Mode to establish basic story elements   
   - Describe what you want to write. Make the first line meaningful, as that's what will show up in Clines history. 
   - Add detail - at any level you want. You can start with a basic description and then iterate - or add as much detail as you want. This might include main character(s), 1st or 3rd perspective, tone, plot points, locations, et al.  It's recommend to set the over all style of the book. For example, "Write this book in the style of Ernest Hemingway" - or "Write this book with a style of minimalist and direct, using simple language, short sentences, and subtle implication to convey deep meaning through action and dialogue" (which somewhat equates to how Hemingway wrote)
   - Answer any questions given to you.
   - Enter in the prompt "initialize memory bank". This will get the memory bank read 

4. **Writing Process**:
   - Once you are ready to start writing the book, writing to Act mode.
   - It will likely write some. 
   - Tell Cline to "update memory bank".  This should fully create the memory bank files - characters, locations, plots, etc.  
   - As for the master outline to be written. Review and feedback changes (if needed)
   - Once the master outline is how you want it, "update memory bank". This will make sure to your start with a updated memory bank
   - You can iterate how you want at this point. The pattern that seems to work the best:
      1.  Ask to "Write chapter 1 outline" (or just "Write the next chapter outline).
      2.  Review and feedback changes
      3.  Ask to "Write chapter 1" (or just "Write the next chapter).
      4.  Review and feedback changes
      5.  Update memory bank
      6.  Repeat until the book is complete
   - It's recommend to read and feedback on each chapter as they are written - you can always make major chnages later (by prompting for it!), but it will take a while and can be error-prone
   - Periodically review all memoiry bank files - if you see a problem, enter a prompt to correct   

5. **Publishing Preparation**:
   - Run the automation scripts in the Production/Scripts directory to assemble and format your manuscript   

## Complete Project Structure

The recommended project structure separates the memory bank (metadata and context) from the actual book content:

```

### Key Distinction

1. **Memory Bank** (book-memory-bank/): Contains metadata and context that helps AI maintain understanding
   - Templates, guidelines, and information ABOUT your book (not the book itself)

2. **Book Content** (project root): The actual manuscript and planning documents
   - Chapters/ - Your actual chapter content
   - Outlines/ - Your actual planning documents
   - Manuscript/ - Complete book files

## Core Files

The foundation of the memory bank consists of five core files located in the Core/ directory:

1. **projectbrief.md** - High-level concept, scope, and goals
2. **story_structure.md** - Purpose, positioning, reader experience, and narrative techniques
3. **world_and_characters.md** - Worldbuilding elements, rules, and character profiles
4. **activeContext.md** - Current work focus and near-term plans
5. **progress.md** - Project tracking and completion status

These files build upon each other in a hierarchical structure, moving from foundational elements to current status.

## Automated Memory Updating

The Book Memory Bank features fully automated updates through Cline's built-in file access capabilities—no scripts or manual updates required:

### Direct Conversational Updates

Cline can automatically maintain your memory bank by:

1. Reading the latest chapter content
2. Identifying new information about characters, world, and plot elements
3. Directly updating all relevant memory bank files
4. Providing a summary of all changes made

This approach leverages Cline's file access to completely automate the memory bank maintenance process with minimal user intervention - no scripts needed, just conversation.

### Using Memory Bank Update Prompts

With specially crafted prompts, you can trigger automatic memory bank updates for both completed chapters and outlines:


### Basic full update

Most of the time you will just ask to update memory bank - this should pick up all changes and update the correct files.  If this is not working, you can use the other Automatic Content Analysis Prompts - the most used will be update:

```

update memory bank

```


#### For Completed Chapters:
```
I've just completed Chapter 5: The Revelation. 

Please:
1. Read the entire chapter content
2. Identify all new information about characters, world elements, and plot developments
3. Automatically update all relevant memory bank files
4. Provide a summary of the updates you've made
```

#### For Chapter Outlines:
```
I've just completed the outline for Chapter 5: The Revelation.

Please:
1. Read the entire outline
2. Identify planned story elements, characters, and world-building components
3. Update all relevant memory bank files with this planned information
4. Mark these elements as "planned" (vs. "established") where appropriate
5. Provide a summary of the updates you've made
```

Cline will analyze the content, identify important information, and directly update all memory bank files without requiring you to run any scripts.

### Consistency Checking and Audits

You can also request automatic consistency checks:

```
Please perform a comprehensive memory bank consistency check.

1. Review all memory bank files for internal consistency
2. Check for contradictions between different memory bank files
3. Verify that character arcs align with plot developments
```

## Workflow Guide

The system supports three primary workflows:

### Initial Planning Workflow
1. Start in **Plan Mode** with high-level concept discussions
2. Extract key elements and populate core files
3. Develop character profiles and world building
4. Create master outline and chapter structure

### Chapter Development Workflow
1. Write individual chapters in the Chapters/ directory
2. Tell Cline: "I've completed Chapter X. Please update the memory bank."
3. Review Cline's summary of updates made to all relevant memory bank files
4. Continue with the next chapter based on the updated memory bank

### Publishing Preparation Workflow
1. Run Production/Scripts/combine_chapters.ps1 to assemble the complete book
2. Use Production/Scripts/generate_docx.bat to create a properly formatted Word document

## Example Usage

### Memory Bank Initialization
```
I want to start a new novel about [concept]. Let's begin by setting up the memory bank.
```

### Chapter Completion and Memory Update
```
I've completed Chapter 3. Please analyze it for new information and update the memory bank files automatically.
```

### Consistency Check
```
Are there any consistency issues between the character development in Chapter 5 and their established profile?
```
